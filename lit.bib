While direct methods solved in practice the phase problem for small molecules, their application to macromolecules is recent and still undergoing strong development. The fundamentals of the methods are described: in particular it is shown how the methods can be optimized for powder, neutron or electron data, and how they can be integrated with isomorphous replacement, molecular replacement and anomalous dispersion techniques. Maximum Entropy methods are also described and discussed. Sets of test structures are used to verify, throughout the various chapters, the mathematical techniques there described and to provide practical examples of applications. This book will appeal to a wide variety of readers - offering both a comprehensive description of direct methods in crystallography and an invaluable reference tool. The first three chapters can be considered as an introduction to the field, with sufficient material to constitute a university course and for allowing the expert use of most direct methods programs. Subsequent chapters are aimed at graduate students and working crystallographers. Basic results are described and discussed in the main body of the text, while the appendices compliment these with in depth mathematical details. The quoted literature is extremely wide and the interested reader can find suggestions for future work and further reading throughout the book.},

We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

The flipping term is dominant when the model is poor and is negligible when the model is a good representation of the target structure. In the case of a random model the Fourier coefficient does not vanish and therefore could allow the recovery of the target structure from a random model. This paper describes a new phasing algorithm which does not require use of the concept of structure invariants or semi-invariants: it is based only on the properties of the new difference electron density and of the observed Fourier synthesis. The algorithm is cyclic and very easy to implement. It has been applied to a large set of small-molecule structures to verify the suitability of the approach.},

The two spaces may be alternated during the phasing procedure or used in a sequential way: for example, first phase and after extend and refine. The tangent approach in ıt SIR2011 belongs to the second category: phases are first estimated by the tangent formula, then their extension and refinement is performed in direct space ıt via electron density modification techniques. In this article a number of new algorithms are described, with the aim of improving the ıt SIR2011 tangent step and allowing more efficient phase extension and refinement. New criteria were chosen for defining the number of reflections to phase, for modifying the tangent weighting scheme, and for fixing the active use of the psi-0 triplets and of the quartet invariants. Each tangent trial may now be submitted to the RELAX procedure, a tool for moving to the correct position a well oriented but misplaced structural model.

	volume = {128},
	abstract = {We propose a technique for producing ‘visual explanations’ for decisions from a large class of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models, making them more transparent and explainable. Our approach—Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), uses the gradients of any target concept (say ‘dog’ in a classification network or a sequence of words in captioning network) flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map highlighting the important regions in the image for predicting the concept. Unlike previous approaches, Grad-CAM is applicable to a wide variety of CNN model-families: (1) CNNs with fully-connected layers (e.g.VGG), (2) CNNs used for structured outputs (e.g.captioning), (3) CNNs used in tasks with multi-modal inputs (e.g.visual question answering) or reinforcement learning, all without architectural changes or re-training. We combine Grad-CAM with existing fine-grained visualizations to create a high-resolution class-discriminative visualization, Guided Grad-CAM, and apply it to image classification, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA) models, including ResNet-based architectures. In the context of image classification models, our visualizations (a) lend insights into failure modes of these models (showing that seemingly unreasonable predictions have reasonable explanations), (b) outperform previous methods on the ILSVRC-15 weakly-supervised localization task, (c) are robust to adversarial perturbations, (d) are more faithful to the underlying model, and (e) help achieve model generalization by identifying dataset bias. For image captioning and VQA, our visualizations show that even non-attention based models learn to localize discriminative regions of input image. We devise a way to identify important neurons through Grad-CAM and combine it with neuron names (Bau et al. in Computer vision and pattern recognition, 2017) to provide textual explanations for model decisions. Finally, we design and conduct human studies to measure if Grad-CAM explanations help users establish appropriate trust in predictions from deep networks and show that Grad-CAM helps untrained users successfully discern a ‘stronger’ deep network from a ‘weaker’ one even when both make identical predictions.

	title = {{PhAI}: {A} deep-learning approach to solve the crystallographic phase problem},
	volume = {385},
	abstract = {X-ray crystallography provides a distinctive view on the three-dimensional structure of crystals. To reconstruct the electron density map, the complex structure factors F=Fexpiϕ of a sufficiently large number of diffracted reflections must be known. In a conventional experiment, only the amplitudes F are obtained, and the phases ϕ are lost. This is the crystallographic phase problem. In this work, we show that a neural network, trained on millions of artificial structure data, can solve the phase problem at a resolution of only 2 angstroms, using only 10 to 20\% of the data needed for direct methods. The network works in common space groups and for modest unit-cell dimensions and suggests that neural networks could be used to solve the phase problem in the general case for weakly scattering crystals. Crystallography is one of the core analytical techniques in the natural sciences. Various experimental advancements, such as noise-free detectors, synchrotrons, free-electron lasers, and the three-dimensional electron density electron diffraction technique, have made it possible to conduct fast experiments on weakly scattering, nanometer-sized crystals. However, interpretation of the data, especially determining the structure, still relies on methods that have not seen significant advancements for many decades. Using deep learning neural networks trained with millions of artificial crystal structures and their corresponding synthetic diffraction data, Larsen et al. developed an approach demonstrating exceptionally high predictive capabilities, which produced accurate electron density maps. The framework considered only centrosymmetric space groups, but with further research, it could be extended to other space groups. —Yury Suleymanov},

Here, it is shown that the charge-flipping algorithm is capable of solving large macromolecular structures with up to {\textbackslash}sim6000 atoms in the asymmetric unit using suitable normalized intensity data at atomic resolution ({\textbackslash}sim1.0Å). Moreover, it is demonstrated that this algorithm also provides an efficient tool for the experimental phasing of highly complex heavy-atom or anomalous scattering substructures at medium to low resolution ({\textbackslash}sim2–6Å) that are frequently difficult to determine using Patterson techniques or direct methods. With the present extension to macromolecular crystallography, charge flipping has proved to be a very well performing and general phase-recovery algorithm in all fields of kinematical diffraction.},

The tangent formula acts as a corrective influence allowing for solutions at resolutions poorer than 1Å. The resulting algorithm solves difficult structures in minutes rather than days or not at all. Modifications include (i) flipping a percentage of charge rather than charge below a threshold value and critically (ii) dampening the magnitude of charge above the threshold; this impedes tangent-formula solutions comprising one or two very intense peaks in the electron density which is commonly known as the `uranium atom solution'. For data at poor resolution, an alternate charge-flipping regime avoids uranium atom solutions by truncating electron-density pixels that are greater than half the maximum value.},

The flipping term is dominant when the model is poor and is negligible when the model is a good representation of the target structure.

This paper describes a new phasing algorithm which does not require use of the concept of structure invariants or semi-invariants: it is based only on the properties of the new difference electron density and of the observed Fourier synthesis. The algorithm is cyclic and very easy to implement. It has been applied to a large set of small-molecule structures to verify the suitability of the approach.},

Interpretation of Patterson maps lies at the foundation of most macromolecular structure elucidation processes, both in determining the position of heavy atoms and/or anomalous scatterers for the isomorphous replacement and anomalous scattering methods, and in determining the orientation and position of a homologous protein model for the molecular-replacement method. The molecular-replacement method also encompasses the use of noncrystallographic redundancy within a crystal or between crystal forms to phase and refine crystal structures. Applications of Patterson and molecular-replacement techniques to structure determination including Patterson interpretation methods, rotation functions, translation functions, symmetry averaging, density modification and phase extension are discussed.

Under ab initio, the solution of a structure from the single-wavelength native data can be understood without the use of a known structure as a search model. Automated heavy-atom location via the Patterson function provides an efficient approach in small-molecule crystallography. For unequal atom structures involving atoms on special positions or pseudosymmetry, Patterson-based methods are often more effective than direct methods. In the case of macromolecules, the Patterson approach can be used to locate the heavier atoms, which then provide slightly better than random phases for partial structure expansion by direct or indirect methods.},

Maximum Entropy methods are also described and discussed.

	abstract = {The overall crystallographic process involves acquiring experimental data and using crystallographic software to find the structure solution. Unfortunately, while diffracted intensities can be measured, the corresponding phases – needed to determine atomic positions – remain experimentally inaccessible (phase problem). Direct methods and the Patterson approach have been successful in solving crystal structures but face limitations with large structures or low-resolution data. Current artificial intelligence (AI) based approaches, such as those recently developed by Larsen ıt et al. [ıt Science (2024), {\textbackslash}bf 385, 522–528], have been applied with success to solve centrosymmetric structures, where the phase is binary (0 or π). The current work proposes a new phasing method designed for AI integration, applicable also to non-centrosymmetric structures, where the phase is a continuous variable. The approach involves discretizing the initial phase values for non-centrosymmetric structures into a few distinct values (ıt e.g. values corresponding to the four quadrants). This reduces the complex phase problem from a continuous regression task to a multi-class classification problem, where only a few phase seed values need to be determined. This discretization allows the use of a smaller training dataset for deep learning models, reducing computational complexity. Our feasibility study results show that this method can effectively solve small, medium and large structures, with the minimum percentage of phase seeds (three or four points in the interval [0,2π]), and 10\% to 30\% of seed symmetry-independent reflections. This phase-seeding method has the potential to extend AI-based approaches to solve crystal structures ıt ab initio, regardless of complexity or symmetry, by combining AI classification algorithms with classical phasing procedures.},
