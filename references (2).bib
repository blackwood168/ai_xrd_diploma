	abstract = {Determining the atomic-level structure of a protein has been a decades-long challenge. However, recent advances in transformers and related neural network architectures have enabled researchers to significantly improve solutions to this problem. These methods use large datasets of sequence information and corresponding known protein template structures, if available. Yet, such methods only focus on sequence information. Other available prior knowledge could also be utilized, such as constructs derived from x-ray crystallography experiments and the known structures of the most common conformations of amino acid residues, which we refer to as partial structures. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first transformer-based model that directly utilizes experimental protein crystallographic data and partial structure information to calculate electron density maps of proteins. In particular, we use Patterson maps, which can be directly obtained from x-ray crystallography experimental data, thus bypassing the well-known crystallographic phase problem. We demonstrate that our method, CrysFormer, achieves precise predictions on two synthetic datasets of peptide fragments in crystalline forms, one with two residues per unit cell and the other with fifteen. These predictions can then be used to generate accurate atomic models using established crystallographic refinement programs.},

The algorithm is tested using synthetic data for a wide range of structures, the solution statistics are analysed and the quality of reconstruction is checked. Finally, mathematical aspects of the algorithm are considered in detail, and these show that in this chaotic iteration process the solution is a limit cycle and not a fixed point.},

	abstract = {Probing the issue of phase retrieval has attracted researchers for many years, due to its wide range of application. Phase retrieval aims to recover an unknown signal from phase-free measurements. Classical alternative projection algorithms have the significant advantages of simplicity and few fine-tuning parameters. However, they suffer from non-convexity and often get stuck in local minima in the presence of noise disturbance. In this work, we develop an efficient hybrid model-based and data-driven approach to solve the phase retrieval problem with deep priors. To effectively utilize the inherent image priors, we propose a deep non-iterative (unfolded) network based on the classic HIO method, referred to as HIONet, which can adaptively learn inherent priors from the truth data distribution. Particularly, we replace the projection operator with trainable deep network, and as a result that learning parameterized function with weights in a supervised manner is equal to learning the prior knowledge from data with truth distributions. In turn, the deep priors learned during training enforce the unfolded network to obtain the optimal solution for phase retrieval problem. In the pipeline of our method, deep priors are incorporated with the physical image formation algorithm, so that the proposed HIONet benefits from the representational capabilities of deep networks, as well as the interpretability and versatility of the traditional well-established algorithms. Moreover, inspired by compounding and aggregating diverse representations to benefit the network for more accurate inference, an enhanced version with cross-blocks features fusion, referred to as HIONet+, is designed to further improve the reconstruction. Extensive experimental results on noisy phase-free measurements show that the developed methods outperform the competitors in terms of quantitative metrics such as PSNR, SSIM and visual effects at all noise levels. In addition, non-oversampling sparse phase retrieval experiments consistently demonstrate that our methods outperform compared methods.},

The fundamentals of the methods are described: in particular it is shown how the methods can be optimized for powder, neutron or electron data, and how they can be integrated with isomorphous replacement, molecular replacement and anomalous dispersion techniques. Maximum Entropy methods are also described and discussed. Sets of test structures are used to verify, throughout the various chapters, the mathematical techniques there described and to provide practical examples of applications. This book will appeal to a wide variety of readers - offering both a comprehensive description of direct methods in crystallography and an invaluable reference tool. The first three chapters can be considered as an introduction to the field, with sufficient material to constitute a university course and for allowing the expert use of most direct methods programs. Subsequent chapters are aimed at graduate students and working crystallographers. Basic results are described and discussed in the main body of the text, while the appendices compliment these with in depth mathematical details.

	abstract = {A recent probabilistic reformulation of the difference electron-density Fourier synthesis [Burla, Caliandro, Giacovazzo \& Polidori (2010). ıt Acta Cryst. A{\textbackslash}bf 66, 347–361] suggested that the most suitable Fourier coefficients are the sum of the classical difference term (ıt mF - ıt DF{\textbackslash}sb ıt p) with a flipping term, depending on the model and on its quality. The flipping term is dominant when the model is poor and is negligible when the model is a good representation of the target structure. In the case of a random model the Fourier coefficient does not vanish and therefore could allow the recovery of the target structure from a random model. This paper describes a new phasing algorithm which does not require use of the concept of structure invariants or semi-invariants: it is based only on the properties of the new difference electron density and of the observed Fourier synthesis. The algorithm is cyclic and very easy to implement. It has been applied to a large set of small-molecule structures to verify the suitability of the approach.},

	abstract = {Third-generation direct methods programs are based on a phasing algorithm (ıt e.g. the tangent or the parameter shift method) and on dual space refinement techniques. The two spaces may be alternated during the phasing procedure or used in a sequential way: for example, first phase and after extend and refine. The tangent approach in ıt SIR2011 belongs to the second category: phases are first estimated by the tangent formula, then their extension and refinement is performed in direct space ıt via electron density modification techniques. In this article a number of new algorithms are described, with the aim of improving the ıt SIR2011 tangent step and allowing more efficient phase extension and refinement. New criteria were chosen for defining the number of reflections to phase, for modifying the tangent weighting scheme, and for fixing the active use of the psi-0 triplets and of the quartet invariants. Each tangent trial may now be submitted to the RELAX procedure, a tool for moving to the correct position a well oriented but misplaced structural model. The resulting procedure shows surprising efficiency, testified by a wide set of applications. The experimental results have been compared with the tangent and VLD (ıt vive la différence) approaches implemented in ıt SIR2011.},

	abstract = {We propose a technique for producing ‘visual explanations’ for decisions from a large class of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models, making them more transparent and explainable. Our approach—Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), uses the gradients of any target concept (say ‘dog’ in a classification network or a sequence of words in captioning network) flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map highlighting the important regions in the image for predicting the concept. Unlike previous approaches, Grad-CAM is applicable to a wide variety of CNN model-families: (1) CNNs with fully-connected layers (e.g.VGG), (2) CNNs used for structured outputs (e.g.captioning), (3) CNNs used in tasks with multi-modal inputs (e.g.visual question answering) or reinforcement learning, all without architectural changes or re-training. We combine Grad-CAM with existing fine-grained visualizations to create a high-resolution class-discriminative visualization, Guided Grad-CAM, and apply it to image classification, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA) models, including ResNet-based architectures. In the context of image classification models, our visualizations (a) lend insights into failure modes of these models (showing that seemingly unreasonable predictions have reasonable explanations), (b) outperform previous methods on the ILSVRC-15 weakly-supervised localization task, (c) are robust to adversarial perturbations, (d) are more faithful to the underlying model, and (e) help achieve model generalization by identifying dataset bias. For image captioning and VQA, our visualizations show that even non-attention based models learn to localize discriminative regions of input image. We devise a way to identify important neurons through Grad-CAM and combine it with neuron names (Bau et al. in Computer vision and pattern recognition, 2017) to provide textual explanations for model decisions. Finally, we design and conduct human studies to measure if Grad-CAM explanations help users establish appropriate trust in predictions from deep networks and show that Grad-CAM helps untrained users successfully discern a ‘stronger’ deep network from a ‘weaker’ one even when both make identical predictions.

	abstract = {X-ray crystallography provides a distinctive view on the three-dimensional structure of crystals. To reconstruct the electron density map, the complex structure factors F=Fexpiϕ of a sufficiently large number of diffracted reflections must be known. In a conventional experiment, only the amplitudes F are obtained, and the phases ϕ are lost. This is the crystallographic phase problem. In this work, we show that a neural network, trained on millions of artificial structure data, can solve the phase problem at a resolution of only 2 angstroms, using only 10 to 20\% of the data needed for direct methods. The network works in common space groups and for modest unit-cell dimensions and suggests that neural networks could be used to solve the phase problem in the general case for weakly scattering crystals. Crystallography is one of the core analytical techniques in the natural sciences. Various experimental advancements, such as noise-free detectors, synchrotrons, free-electron lasers, and the three-dimensional electron density electron diffraction technique, have made it possible to conduct fast experiments on weakly scattering, nanometer-sized crystals. However, interpretation of the data, especially determining the structure, still relies on methods that have not seen significant advancements for many decades. Using deep learning neural networks trained with millions of artificial crystal structures and their corresponding synthetic diffraction data, Larsen et al. developed an approach demonstrating exceptionally high predictive capabilities, which produced accurate electron density maps. The framework considered only centrosymmetric space groups, but with further research, it could be extended to other space groups. —Yury Suleymanov},
